# Maze_Solver

A command-line pathfinding application built using C++ and core data structures. This project demonstrates how DFS (Depth-First Search) and BFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithms can be applied to solve mazes represented as 2D matrices.


ðŸ“Œ Project Description

The Maze Solver allows the user to input or define a maze as a 2D matrix of walls and paths, and find a valid path from a starting point to an exit using both:

- **DFS**: Explores all possible paths using backtracking  
- **BFS**: Guarantees the shortest path using a queue-based level-order traversal  

The project provides visual feedback of the solution path in the console and is designed with flexibility for additional features like multiple exits and random maze generation.


ðŸ“Œ Methodology

- The maze is represented as a 2D grid:
  - `0` = path  
  - `1` = wall  
- **DFS** is implemented using recursion and backtracking, storing the path when it reaches the goal  
- **BFS** is implemented using a queue with a parent-tracking array to reconstruct the shortest path after reaching the exit  
- Input is currently hardcoded but can be extended to support:
  - File input  
  - Dynamic grid size  
  - Random maze generation  


ðŸ“Œ Use Cases

- Teaching pathfinding algorithms in DSA courses  
- Algorithm visualization and debugging  
- Robotics path simulation on grids  
- Foundation for game level logic (mazes, dungeons)  


ðŸ“Œ Skills Used

- C++ (recursion, conditionals, loops)  
- 2D arrays and grid traversal  
- STL: `queue`, `vector`, `pair`  
- DFS with backtracking  
- BFS with shortest path reconstruction  



ðŸ“Œ Key Features

- Input maze as a 2D array 
- Solve using:
  - **DFS**: Finds *a* path to exit  
  - **BFS**: Finds *shortest* path to exit  
- Output path as sequence of coordinates  
- Visual path tracing in console  


ðŸ“Œ Application Areas

- Game AI or logic engine for maze levels  
- Grid-based robot simulation (e.g., warehouse bots)  
- Any problem involving search in graphs or matrices  


ðŸ“Œ Scope for Improvement

- Support file-based maze input/output  
- Add visualization using SFML or ASCII animation  
- Add multiple exit detection  
- Implement A* or Dijkstra for weighted mazes  
- Generate large random mazes with more obstacles
